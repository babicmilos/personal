I am a dedicated researcher and technology enthusiast who brings creative work into the domain of fighting for a fairer and more advanced society. You can find all my recent works on my social media.

I am primarly interested in developing the better society so some of the topics that I like are:
- Cooperatives and solidarity economy
- Upcycling
- Free technology
- Communication
- Art

If you assume that we are interested in the same topics or that we can collaborate in any way, write me a message on [email](mailto:babicmilos217@gmail.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com/milosbabic_), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milo%C5%A1-babi%C4%87-103b71171/) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/milos.babic22). ðŸ˜Š
